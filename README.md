Show me the colors:

1. export all of your colors throughout your app from a single color file
2. import them throughout your app
3. show_me_the_colors is an auto generated visual representation of those colors.

This auto generated visial document can also import other files and auto load svgs, logos, components, icons.

Always know what assets are in your application to be able to communicate and compare with your designer's design system.
